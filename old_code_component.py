#   The parser works by chaining inside if statements verifications and tree building. We translate
#   the rules by creating a node and passing it to a common verifier (this is the one from the super class)
#   . Then the node is parsed inside the verifier and the return value is used to determine if the node is attached
#   or not to the parent tree. this happens for each node recursively and when the parser arrives at a non-token node,
#   it verifies if the name is legal and parses moves the cursor to the next token of code. this effectively makes
#   this whole parser just a big if statement linked together and the final value of this of programNode
#   is if the string is pared or not. An exception error can be created, but the output is still a bit buggy.
#   Also note, that the string to be parsed has a first pass to tokenize the string between each space,
#   then a program root node is created and parsed. The whole parser uses global variable for the cursor and parse
#   string for simplicityâ€™s sake. All nodes are created from the same AbstractNode, so they have very similar functions.
